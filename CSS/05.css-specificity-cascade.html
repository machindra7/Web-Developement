<!-- The Cascade Algorithm:
CSS stands for Cascading Stylesheets. The cascade is the algorithm for solving conflicts where multiple CSS rules apply to an HTML element. It's the reason that the text of the button styled with the above CSS will be purple.

Understanding the cascade algorithm helps you understand how the browser resolves conflicts like this. The cascade algorithm has 4 distinct stages.

Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules appear
Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match
Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from a browser extension, or your authored CSS
Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the !important rule type -->

<!-- Effect of Position:
If there are two rules that have selectors of identical specificity, the last one to be declared won. In an HTML page, you can add styles in different ways: through a <link> tag, a <style> tag, or directly in the element's style attribute. If you have one <link> tag at the top of your page and another at the bottom, the styles from the bottom one will be used. The same goes for <style> tags; the ones lower down on the page take priority. -->

<!--  An inline style attribute with CSS declared in it will override all other CSS, regardless of its position, unless a declaration has !important defined.
If the browser doesn't support a property, it is ignored!  -->

<!-- /* Specificity:
CSS specificity determines which style rules get applied to an element when there are conflicts. Higher specificity means the style will be used. It's calculated based on a point system involving inline styles, IDs, classes, and tag names. */ -->

<!-- /* Inline styles have the highest specificity and will always override styles if other selector(s) are also defined. */ -->

<!-- /* Element selectors like <p>, <div>, <a>, etc. have low specificity. */ -->

<!-- /* Universal selectors (*) and combining selectors like not, first-child, and last-child have the lowest specificity. */ -->

<!-- /* the order of specificity is:
Inline Style > ID Selector > Class or Attribute Selector > Element Selector > Universal Selector */ -->

<!-- /* Specificity Calculation:
To calculate specificity, assign a value to each part of the selector:

Universal Selector: 0
Element selectors and pseudo-elements: 1
Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes: 10
ID selectors: 100
Inline styles: 1000
Then, add up the values of all the parts in the selector. */ -->
